Some resources I found valuable when I started learning Software Development.
Most of this stuff would be suitable for beginner or intermediate software engineers.


# Software Engineering


## Concepts


##### Code Complete [link](http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670)

Read this one book first.
It is mostly about "construction", design, code management and better decision making on how to implement. It is more about concepts than Clean Code. Other topics include when to stop designing and start coding, when to write a class and when not to, how to work with input data, how to debug, ...


##### Clean Code [link](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)

Read this one after Code Complete.
This is about specifically writing code. It's mainly about very practical topics such as naming, function size, how many arguments to use and why.


##### The Clean Coder [link](http://www.amazon.com/The-Clean-Coder-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073)

Read this one after Clean Code.
This book is about how to behave like a professional engineer.

##### Martin Fawler [twitter](https://twitter.com/martinfowler), [blog](http://www.martinfowler.com/)

Read his work, watch his talks.

## Front-End Development


##### MDN: Mozilla Developer Network [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web.)

High quality collaborative documentation on web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs, Graphics, ...)
Use this when you have a question about front-end fundamentals (or advanced topics).


##### Front-end Handbook [link](https://www.gitbook.com/book/frontendmasters/front-end-handbook/details)

A nice quick high level introduction for learning about the practice of front-end development.


##### Good UI [link](http://www.goodui.org/)

A great list of UI best practices.

##### A Frotn End Engineer Manifesto [link](http://f2em.com/)

A nice reminder of what is important in front-end development.


## Back-End Development


##### Learn about API, REST, Web Standards. [link](http://codeplanet.io/principles-good-restful-api-design/) [link](http://jsonapi.org/)


## Misc

 - Learn about databases, caches and how memory and CPU works. Get knowledge about computers themselves and how programs are ran at low level.

 - Know algorithms, complexity and data structure.
A great Stanford online course: https://www.coursera.org/course/algo

 - Know some machine learning

## Infrasctructure


##### A Comprehensive Guide to Building a Scalable Web App [link](https://www.airpair.com/aws/posts/building-a-scalable-web-app-on-amazon-web-services-p1)

This explains very well the concepts behind building the infrasctuture and architecture behind a web app. A good part of the article is not AWS specific.


# Languages


## Javascript


##### Essential Javascript links [link](https://github.com/ericelliott/essential-javascript-links#essential-javascript-links)

"A curated list by Eric Elliott and friends. This is a very exclusive collection of only must-have JavaScript links."


## Python


##### The Zen of Python [link](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)

Much like the ten commandments for Python developers


##### The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python! [link](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/)

This opinionated guide exists to provide both novice and expert Python developers a best practice handbook to the installation, configuration, and usage of Python on a daily basis.


##### Python tips. intermediate Python [link](http://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/)

The topics which are discussed in this book open up your mind towards some nice corners of Python language.


##### PEP8 [link](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

A style guide for Python, written by its creator. Follow it. Use a PEP8 linter for your code.
