Some resources I found valuable when I started learning Software Development.
Most of this stuff would be suitable for beginner or intermediate software engineers.


# Software Engineering


## Concepts


### Code Complete

http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670
Read this one book first.
It is mostly about "construction", design, code management and better decision making on how to implement. It is more about concepts than Clean Code. Other topics include when to stop designing and start coding, when to write a class and when note, how to work with input data, how to debug, ...


### Clean Code

http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882
Read this one after Code Complete.
This is about writing code specifically. It's about very practical topics such as naming, function size, how many arguments to use and why.


### The Clean Coder

http://www.amazon.com/The-Clean-Coder-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073
Read this one after Clean Code.
This book is about how to behave like a professional engineer.

### Martin Fawler

Read his work, watch his talks.

## Front-End Development


### MDN: Mozilla Developer Network

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web.
High quality collaborative documentation on web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs, Graphics, ...)
Use this when you have a question about front-end fundamentals (or not).


### Front-end Handbook

https://www.gitbook.com/book/frontendmasters/front-end-handbook/details
A nice quick high level introduction for learning about the practice of front-end development.


### Good UI
http://www.goodui.org/
A great list of UI best practices.


## Back-End Development


### Learn about API, REST, Web Standards.

http://jsonapi.org/
Note: When designing both front and back-end: start with the front-end to help designing the API interface.


## Misc
 - Learn about databases, caches and how memory and CPU works. Get knowledge about computers themselves and how programs are ran at low level.

 - Know algorithms, complexity and data structure.
A great Stanford online course: https://www.coursera.org/course/algo

 - Know some machine learning

## Infrasctructure


### A Comprehensive Guide to Building a Scalable Web App
[architecture/devops]
https://www.airpair.com/aws/posts/building-a-scalable-web-app-on-amazon-web-services-p1
This explains very well the concepts behind building the infrasctuture and architecture behind a web app. A good part of the article is not AWS specific.


# Languages


## Javascript


### Essential Javascript links

The topics which are discussed in this book open up your mind towards some nice corners of Python language.


### PEP8

https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
A style guide for Python, written by its creator. Follow it. Use a PEP8 linter for your code.
